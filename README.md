## üë®‚Äçüíª Presentation

Hey! I'm a developer who loves low-level systems, clean design, and building powerful tools. Whether I'm optimizing memory in C, building full-stack apps with React/Next.js, or tuning Postgres queries‚ÄîI'm in my element.

I believe in open-source, strong typing, brutal debugging, and learning from the best.
